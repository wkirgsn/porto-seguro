# porto-seguro kaggle competition
This project contains my proceedings dealing with the porto-seguro safe driver competition launched on Kaggle, which ended Nov 2017.
My score is not a big deal, though I'd like to highlight in this repo the way one can write python classes for feature engineering.

## Quickstart
Starting the project with

`>>> python main.py`

This will load the dataset from _input_ folder, does a bit feature engineering and trains a LGBM model whose output will be saved to the _out_ folder. Make sure, that you have the correct train and test data downloaded from [kaggle's competition site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction) and saved in the _input_ folder.
